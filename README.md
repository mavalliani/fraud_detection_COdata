Fraud Detection using the following methods:

Please read the details of the work below:
1. The ipynb is a jupyter notebook file which I recommend run with GPU.
2. I have worked with the entire dataset and ran 2 traditional ML models (Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor) and 1 deep learning method (Autoencoder).
3. The entire work takes ~15 minutes to run, so I recommend you hit that ‘Run all’ button and read the answers as you go.
4. I have pasted answers to the Question 4 (Model) in this document as well for easy reference. You can refer to the notebook for the detailed work.
5. Local Outlier Factor algorithm has been commented as it took ~10 min itself. To run that, please uncomment it.


### Future Work:
It was shown in the notebook (using TSNE, PCA, truncatedSVD) that the features used are not really indicative of the classes and more useful features need to be developed to get the F1 score up.
Location and IP based data can be used for feature engineering.
F1 score and corresponding precision and recall are the performance metrics that should be followed.
